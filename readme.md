# nodriver-cf-verify

A lightweight, asynchronous extension for **nodriver** and **zendriver** that detects and verifies Cloudflare Turnstile challenges.


## üöÄ Description

`nodriver-cf-verify` is a lightweight plugin for the **nodriver** and **zendriver** projects.

It automatically detects whether a webpage is protected by a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge and attempts to verify it using the browser automation interfaces provided by **nodriver** or **zendriver**.

This extension is particularly useful for automating headless access to pages protected by Cloudflare's JavaScript- or iframe-based Turnstiles.



## ‚úÖ Features

- Detects Cloudflare protection scripts.
- Locates the embedded Turnstile iframe.
- Simulates a click on the challenge.
- Works asynchronously using `asyncio`.
- Supports retrying with configurable intervals.
- Provides support for the `nodriver` and `zendriver` libraries.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `nodriver`
- `zendriver` (optional, if preferred over `nodriver`)
- `asyncio` (standard library)


## üì¶ Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip (this will install `nodriver` and `zendriver`):
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure `nodriver` or `zendriver` is available in your environment.

You can also install it manually:
- pip install nodriver
- pip install zendriver (optional, if preferred over `nodriver`)


## üíª Example Usage with `nodriver` library

```python
import nodriver, time
from nodriver_cf_verify import CFVerify

async def main() -> None:
    browser: nodriver.Browser = await nodriver.start()
    browser_tab: nodriver.Tab = await browser.get("https://nowsecure.nl")

    start: float = time.perf_counter()

    cf_verify: CFVerify = CFVerify(_browser_tab = browser_tab, _debug = True)
    success: bool = await cf_verify.verify(_max_retries = 15, _interval_between_retries = 1, _reload_page_after_n_retries = 0)

    duration: float = (time.perf_counter() - start)

    if not success:
        print(f"Failed to verify Cloudflare. Elapsed time: {duration:.2f} seconds.")
        return

    print(f"Cloudflare was successfully verified in {duration:.2f} seconds.")

nodriver.loop().run_until_complete(future = main())
```


## üíª Example Usage with `zendriver` library

```python
import zendriver, asyncio, time
from nodriver_cf_verify import CFVerify

async def main() -> None:
    browser: zendriver.Browser = await zendriver.start()
    browser_tab: zendriver.Tab = await browser.get("https://nowsecure.nl")

    start: float = time.perf_counter()

    cf_verify: CFVerify = CFVerify(_browser_tab = browser_tab, _debug = True)
    success: bool = await cf_verify.verify(_max_retries = 15, _interval_between_retries = 1, _reload_page_after_n_retries = 0)

    duration: float = (time.perf_counter() - start)

    if not success:
        print(f"Failed to verify Cloudflare. Elapsed time: {duration:.2f} seconds.")
        return

    print(f"Cloudflare was successfully verified in {duration:.2f} seconds.")

asyncio.run(main = main())
```
